# ðŸ“š Not Alone

A volunteer recruitment site/database developed in partnership with OpSAFE, an NPO that hosts camps for kids that have suffered from traumatic experiences. Not Alone allows camp organizers setting up a new camp page to immediately contact existing volunteers in the location of the new camp for recruitment.
